# Contributing to StackTuring 
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github :octocat:
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License ‚öñÔ∏è
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code ü™≤
Please try to be as descriptive yet clear when describing a bug or an issue. This helps us in understanging and consecutively solving the issue ASAP.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style üíª

* Single quotes are preferrred over double.
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
* We use [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for python based projects.
* [`gofmt`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt) is used for golang.
* Feel free to reach out to use for more details.
